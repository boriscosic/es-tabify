# es-tabify

A function that converts ElasticSearch results into a table data structure.

The returned table data structure is similar to that returned by [d3-dsv](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv).


Inspired by [Kibana's tabify implementation](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/src/ui/public/agg_response/tabify/tabify.js)
